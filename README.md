### Introduction

Gym Planner is a web application designed to aid the individual user in developing a specific exercise routine for them personally; based on variables such as their preferred workout type, their goals, along with their age, physique and BMI. The initial goal is for users of all levels of fitness and workout experience to be able to quickly and intuitively set up a basic workout plan to suit their needs. Gym Planner will be responsive for frequent and returning users because as the user continues to exercise and input their new figures (for BMI for example) their tailored workout plan will take these into account and continue to develop the most suitable workout plan for the new given metrics.

The concept was developed for the purpose of completing the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built to express the knowledge and skills gained from the HTML, CSS, User Centric Design and Interactive Front End Development modules.

### Structure

##### Architecture

Gym Spotter is built using pure HTML5 and CSS according to the principles of creating a responsive and accessible static front-end user-centric website. Bootstrap and media queries were also used to ensure responsive design.

##### User Experience Design

For fist time visitors I imagined the user wanting to quickly and easily develop and retrieve a personalised workout plan tailored to them and their needs, without overwhelming information or overly complex data input. For frequent and returning users I wanted offer a basic framework where they can set and improve on their own exercise goals, and monitor their personal performance against certain external standards that regular gym goers would be already aware of. In both cases I wanted clear and easily navigable content on desktop, tablet and also mobile device so users can effectively set their goals and monitor their progress while working out or while taking some rest in their downtime.

##### Navigation

All Pages will contain a Navigation menu at the top of the Webpage that directs them to a new Page to easily allow users to Navigate the site easily. The Nav Menu will be collapsible on a Mobile device to make use of space on smaller devices. The homepage will give a brief introduction to the purpose of the site itself. "Plans and Goals" will provide users with the basic information to get started. "Contact and Social" will help users to stay on track through positive engagement and accountability. "External Resources" will provide paths for users to enhance and develop their workout plans and lifestyle according to the principles introduced in previous sections.

Across all devices and screen sizes the layout will remain clean and the flow of information will progress logically, enhanced at certain points by CTAs. All pages will contain a footer with social media contact links for further engagement. Certain elements on each page will respond interactively to help users move through the information flow of the site.
