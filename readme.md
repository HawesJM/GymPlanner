### Introduction

Gym Planner is a web application designed to aid the individual user in developing a specific exercise routine for them personally; based on variables such as their preferred workout type, their goals, along with their age, physique and BMI. The initial goal is for users of all levels of fitness and workout experience to be able to quickly and intuitively set up a basic workout plan to suit their needs. Gym Planner will be responsive for frequent and returning users because as the user continues to exercise and input their new figures (for BMI for example) their tailored workout plan will take these into account and continue to develop the most suitable workout plan for the new given metrics.

The concept was developed for the purpose of completing the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built to express the knowledge and skills gained from the HTML, CSS, User Centric Design and Interactive Front End Development modules.

### Structure

##### Architecture

Gym Spotter is built using pure HTML5 and CSS according to the principles of creating a responsive and accessible static front-end user-centric website. Bootstrap and media queries were also used to ensure responsive design.

##### User Experience Design

For fist time visitors I imagined the user wanting to quickly and easily develop and retrieve a personalised workout plan tailored to them and their needs, without overwhelming information or overly complex data input. For frequent and returning users I wanted offer a basic framework where they can set and improve on their own exercise goals, and monitor their personal performance against certain external standards that regular gym goers would be already aware of. In both cases I wanted clear and easily navigable content on desktop, tablet and also mobile device so users can effectively set their goals and monitor their progress while working out or while taking some rest in their downtime.

##### Navigation

There will be one main page with a header including logo, title and navigation links, as well as a footer containing copyright information and social media links for further engagement. The main page and landing page will be a multi-stage form quiz taking the user's basic information and using it do create and display a specific workout plan tailored to the individual user and their data submitted during the session. The navigation links will provide some introduction and further useful information in the form of external resources and FAQs to aid the user in achieving their goals. The navigation menu will be collapsible on mobile devices to make best use of the available space. Across all devices and screen sizes the layout will remain clean and the order of the main form will progress logically, interactively and intuitively through well signposted submission fields and submission buttons.

### Design

##### Colour Scheme

Over a paper white background the homepage will show a main section and form container using Orange #ED6B47 .  This will contain the main CTA button using Navy Blue #112A46 with a Grey #999 box shadow for contrast. Turquoise #7df9ffb3 and Orange #ED6B47 are used as accent colours for buttons/progress bars and in hover instances to give feedback to the user. White #fafafa is used for text over button and form progress steps for clarity and contrast.
